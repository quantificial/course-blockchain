## create a blockchain

hash the block which contain data, timestamp, previous hash and then add the nonce to check whether the hash is smaller than a value, such as "0000000" to proof the work

it is required to "mine" the nonce.... 

refer to module 1 - create a blockchain

use flask and simple hash lib to create a block chain
